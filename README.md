This project explores cross-country differences in public support for transgender individuals obtaining official documents matching their gender identity (question cq19 in the ZA7575 questionnaire) based on the Special Eurobarometer 493: Discrimination in the EU dataset (2019).

The study has two primary objectives:

- Explaining Cross-Country Differences in Support Levels through an analysis of individual-level survey data and country-level factors to understand the variation in support for transgender rights across 28 EU countries.

- Developing a Predictive Model for Other Countries through the application of machine learning techniques to predict support levels in countries beyond the sample using key individual and country-level indicators.
